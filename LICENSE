Trademark and Branding:

Upon the release of your game to end-users, it is absolutely necessary to remove any trademarks, symbols (such as our "A symbol"), and any text passages that are associated with us, terms like (Assambra, Omnia, Free-MMORPG). In addition, the name of the game, currently 'Free-MMORPG', must be changed, and if later renamed to 'Omnia', the new name must also not be used in any way. If you wish to mention us in the credits, these are exempt from the aforementioned requirements.
